Through trial and error my ending result had 2 layers with 10 neurons in the first and 6 neurons in the second. What I did to attempt to improve model performance was remove highly distributed columns, binning and dropping columns, changing the number of neurons, layers, and epochs, and tried different activation functions. If I were to try a different model, I would try random forest for its resistance to overfitting, ability to handle tabular data, and its speed over neural networks.
